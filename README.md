# etch-a-sketch

Hi! Welcome to etch-a-sketch, a The Odin Project javascript project.

Here, you can draw to your heart's desire, with colour mode (allowing to pick different colours), eraser mode (incase you want to change something), and rainbow mode (for the extra fun factor).
To resize the grid, move the slider and press the 'clear' button (note: this will clear the current grid).

The grid was created using loops and divs in js, which was then formatted through flexbox, since this exercise was designed to be done before learning css grid.

I hope you enjoy what i've made!
